##BIG Data Algorithms: MAP/REDUCE##

In this Algorithm we analize a series of data about the communication over Internet.
We have an input file with Local IP address, Public IP address, direction of the connection and the Ports.
We try to analize the traffic and find the IP that create a lot of connection for do this we use
the Big Data Algorithms based on MaP Reduce. We will MAP our data into another Set and after reduce the input data
for obtain a limited set more homogenius.
